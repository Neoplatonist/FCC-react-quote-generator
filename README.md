Free Code Camp - Random Quote Machine
=====================

This is my solution to the [FCC - Build a Random Quote Machine](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-random-quote-machine).
The live demo can be seen here: [CodePen](https://codepen.io/Neoplatonist/pen/NrNQMa).

### Requirements
* Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/ONjoLe/.
* Rule #1: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.
* Rule #2: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
* User Story: I can click a button to show me a new random quote.
* User Story: I can press a button to tweet out a quote.
